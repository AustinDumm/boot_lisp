# Boot Lisp

A simple, minimal lisp interpreter intended to be used to bootstrap a Scheme compiler

Built for educational purposes and to experiment with bootstrapping compilation. Currently only a lisp interpreter, boot lisp is targeted to also be compilable down to a yet-undetermined language (likely c or LLIR). This compilable boot lisp will be the target for a library of source to source transformations from Scheme down to boot lisp forming a Scheme compiler. This plan is still a work in progress and subject to change.
